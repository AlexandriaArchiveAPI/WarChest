## Background
The conflict began with the Ionian Revolt (499–494 BCE), when Greek cities in Asia Minor resisted Persian rule. Athens and Eretria supported the revolt, provoking Persia. Darius I launched invasions of Greece, including the famous defeat at Marathon in 490 BCE. His successor Xerxes I renewed the campaign, leading to the critical battles of Thermopylae and Salamis.
