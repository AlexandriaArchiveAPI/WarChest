## Background
Persian king Xerxes invaded Greece in 480 BCE to subjugate the city-states after earlier defeats at Marathon. The Greeks chose to defend the narrow pass at Thermopylae, a natural chokepoint that could neutralize the Persians’ numbers.

## The Battle
- **Deployment:** Greeks, led by King Leonidas and his Spartans, held the narrow pass.  
- **Tactics:** The Greeks used the terrain to force Persians into close combat, where heavy hoplite armor and discipline gave them an advantage.  
- **Course of Battle:** For two days, the Greeks repelled repeated Persian assaults. On the third day, a local traitor revealed a mountain path that allowed the Persians to outflank the defenders. Leonidas dismissed most of the Greek army, remaining with his Spartans, Thespians, and Thebans to cover the retreat. All were overwhelmed.

## Aftermath
Although the battle was a tactical defeat, it delayed the Persian advance and inspired Greek unity. Soon after, Greek naval victories at Artemisium and later Salamis turned the tide of the war.
